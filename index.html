                <h2>Feeding the Hungry</h2>
                <p id="pragraph">It is reported in a hadith that Prophet Muhammad said, “Feed the hungry, visit the sick, and set free the captives." Islam advocates feeding the hungry, regardless of race, religion or background. It is such an important part of the religion that Prophet Muhammad said a person is not really a Muslim if he goes to bed satiated while his neighbor goes hungry. Prophet Muhammad said that the believer's shade on the Day of Judgment will be his charity. Humility in giving is strongly encouraged in Islam. One hadith states that one of the seven people who will be shaded by God on the Day of Judgment is “a man who gives charity so secretly that his left hand does not know what his right hand has given.”</p><br><br>
